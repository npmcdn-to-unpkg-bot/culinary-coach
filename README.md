Recipe webapp for Clients to access past recipes from Culinary Coach sessions.

  Culinary Coach is a project I began working on in November 2015. I wanted to create a portal for
  customers of Culinary Coach to revisit their experience with the service and provide a useful place
  for them to access recipes. The Culinary Coach Admin(s) is able to grant their customers access to any
  number of the recipes in the database or add their own through the Admin Page. The customer can view
  only those recipes they've been granted access too. On each recipe the customer can add notes recipes
  that are only viewable by the notes author. No Contact information is included yet as the business
  hasn't opened yet. (Fall 2016)
